## About

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGAâ€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

## Usage

The extension currently offers 4 core features, with more to come.

- Syntax Highlighting for OpenFGA files
- A unique theme for OpenFGA for VS Code
  - Once installed, go to your extensions
  - Click on `OpenFGA` and click `Set Color Scheme`
  - Click on `OpenFGA Dark` in the prompt

![Prompt to set OpenFGA Dark color scheme](resources/set-color-scheme.png)

- A command to transform `.fga` OpenFGA files to `JSON`
  - Open a `.fga` OpenFGA file in the editor
  - Open the `Command Pallette` using Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Command+Shift+P (OSX)
  - Select `OpenFGA: Transform DSL to JSON`
  - A new tab will open with the transformed code

![Prompt to execute OpenFGA: Transform DSL to JSON command](resources/transform-command-select.png)

- Validation of OpenFGA's `.fga` files
  - As you type in a `.fga` OpenFGA file in the editor, the extension will highlight errors that make your models invalid

- Running tests through the CLI and viewing output inline
  - Open a terminal in VS Code
  - Run `npm run test-inline` to execute the tests and display the output inline

## Workflow to use it with the FGA CLI

The extension works great when combined with the [FGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli) to iterate on your model and test it.

In order to do that:
1- Create a working directory to house the files for your store
2- Inside this directory, create a `model.fga` file with your model
3- Alongside the `model.fga`, create a `store.yaml` file with the following syntax

```yaml
---
name: Store Name # store name, optional
model_file: ./model.fga # a global model that would apply to all tests
tuples: # global tuples that would apply to all tests, optional
  - user: folder:1
    relation: parent
    object: folder:2
  - user: user:anne
    relation: editor
    object: folder:1
tests: # required
  - name: test-1
    description: testing that the model works # optional
    tuples: # tuples that only apply within the scope of this test
      - user: user:beth
        relation: viewer
        object: folder:2
    check: # a set of checks to run
      - user: user:anne
        object: folder:1
        assertions:
          # a set of expected results for each relation
          can_view: true
          can_write: true
          can_share: false
      - user: user:beth
        object: folder:2
        assertions:
          # a set of expected results for each relation
          can_view: true
          can_write: false
          can_share: false
    list_objects: # a set of list objects to run
      - user: user:anne
        type: folder
        assertions:
          # a set of expected results for each relation
          can_view:
            - folder:1
            - folder:2
          can_write:
            - folder:1
            - folder:2
          can_share: []
      - user: user:beth
        type: folder
        assertions:
          # a set of expected results for each relation
          can_view:
            - folder:2
          can_write: []
          can_share: []
```

When ready to test, from the terminal, and while inside your working directory, run:

```shell
fga model test --tests=./store.yaml
```
